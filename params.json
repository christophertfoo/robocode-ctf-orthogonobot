{"name":"robocode-ctf-orthogonobot","tagline":"A competitive Robocode robot.","body":"### Welcome to the robocode-ctf-orthogonobot project.\r\n\r\n![Enemy go BOOM!](https://raw.github.com/saxyrunes/robocode-ctf-orthogonobot/gh-pages/images/Orthogonobot.png)\r\n\r\nrobocode-ctf-orthogonobot is a [Robocode](http://robocode.sourceforge.net/) robot that attempts crush its opponents with a mix of offense and defense.\r\n\r\n#### Offense\r\n* Uses a distance sensitive firing mechanism to ensure that the strongest (and most costly) bullets are saved only for close range targets that are more likely to be hit.\r\n* If the enemy is almost dead and orthogonobot is still healthy, go in for the kill!  Chase the enemy down and fire the strongest bullets from point-blank range.\r\n\r\n#### Defense\r\n* Recognizes when an opponent fires a bullet and dodges out of the way using a location sensitive methods to prevent the orthogonobot from becoming cornered.\r\n* Keep the orthogonobot's body perpendicular to the enemy.  The quickest path out of a bullet's path is a line perpendicular to its trajectory.\r\n\r\n#### Weaknesses\r\n* Currently fires directly at the enemy with no leading.  Accuracy against constantly moving robots can be poor.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
